# Algorithms and Complexity

This repository is developed as part of the CSALCOMP (Algorithms and Complexities) course. It serves as a practical exploration of core algorithmic techniques and their applications in solving computational problems. The focus lies in both the implementation and analysis of algorithms, with an emphasis on understanding and optimizing time and space complexity.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the efficiency of various algorithmic strategies through hands-on problem-solving. It involves working through a diverse set of problemsâ€”from sorting and searching to graph traversal and optimization challenges. Each solution is accompanied by complexity analysis and designed to reflect real-world scenarios that require critical thinking and efficient computation.

By building and refining these solutions, the project aims to deepen the understanding of computational complexity, reinforce foundational concepts in data structures and algorithms, and develop problem-solving skills essential for both academia and industry.
